      <p Style = "font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;">Hi my name is Arielle Fashakin. I am in my final semester at the University of Houston Downtown. I am a Post-Bac student and my major is computer science. The classes that I enjoyed the most have been Introduction to Computer Science with Python, Introduction to Computer science with C++, Digital Logic, Theory of Computation, and Database Management. This semester I am taking 5 courses, Programing Language Concepts, Operating Systems, Network Security, Introduction to Network Architecture, and Web Programming. So far out of the 5 classes I believe the two most challenging courses will be Program Language Concepts, and Operating Systems. I feel like this semester will be my most beneficial due to all my classes being extremely practical when it come to preparing me for a career. I am currently working in an internship with Boeing, the experience has been extremely enlightening and has opened my eyes to how vast computer science and computer engineering is. One thing I have noticed is that you never stop learning there will always be something new to learn. The web programming class is much needed for me, I have not had any experience with web programming and I felt like this class is a basic skill that I need to have knowledge in. So far we have learned about html which I have never used before but I do have an idea about what it is. From what I have learned thus far html is a text based language that is used to input and modify text on a web page. Html can be used for media and links as well. And the next language we will learn about is css which I believe has to do more with formatting. </p>
